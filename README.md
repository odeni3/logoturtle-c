# logoturtle-c

Second programming project - university - computer engineering (2nd period).

The logoturtle program was made using the Ncurses library, which only supports linux, that is, if you are a windows user, you must use WSL.

Run all .c files in WSL or Linux prompt, using:

2- ls

3- ./a.out
